Title:
Theoretical and experimental investigations of high-power self-mode-locked Pr:YLF visible
lasers
Author:
Zhiping Cai


The authors demonstrated in this manuscript an efficient self-mode-lock oscillation of Pr:YLF lasers in the visible spectral

 for the first
time with a diode-pumped Pr:YLF laser at 522 and 639 nm. The average power of those mode-lock
laser was 0.68 and 1.44 W at 522 and 639 nm, respectively. Since mode-locking has been
demonstrated for diode-pumped Pr:YLF lasers, so far, only with SESAM and the average output
powers were limited to less than 100 mW, this scheme could open up new application with those
visible sub-nanosecond laser pulses. The authors speculated the mechanism of the self-starting
mode-lock oscillation as the Stark splitting of laser medium induced by laser cavity field, which was
reported by Yingxin Bai in 1993 for gas lasers such as HeNe, copper vaper and CuBr, and simulated
their experimental spectra with a numerical model. In fact, the authors reported very interesting
pulsing phenomena for a diode-pumped Pr:YLF laser. However, since Bai’s theory has never applied
any solid-state lasers, the author should be more careful to conclude and collect more experimental
data to support the authors’ conclusion. For example, it is not 100% clear for an argument that the
pulsation was rather caused simply by spectral beating among few longitudinal modes. Therefore, I
request authors following additional measurements to ensure the author’s opinion and conclusion.
Also, I recommend to revise the following points before re-review this manuscript.
